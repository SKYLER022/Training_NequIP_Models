ðŸš€ Data Preparation for ML with NequIP

Prepare training data for NequIP machine learning models using VASP MD results. This repository provides tools to extract data, train models, and validate predictions.

ðŸŒŸ Features

Extract training data in extxyz format from VASP's OUTCAR.
Seamless integration with NequIP for machine learning training.
Tools for testing and validating ML models against SCF calculations.
Scripts for visualizing results with energy and force comparison plots.
ðŸ“‹ Workflow

1. Perform VASP AIMD Calculations
Prepare molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using VASP. Use the provided example INCAR file: INCAR_MDexample.

2. Generate Training Data
Use the script write_extxyz.py to convert data from VASP's OUTCAR to an extxyz file for training.

python write_extxyz.py OUTCAR nequip-data.extxyz
3. Train the Model with NequIP
Train the NequIP model using nequip-data.extxyz and a configuration file config.yaml.

nequip-train config.yaml
4. Deploy the Model
Once training is complete, deploy the trained model:

nequip-deploy build --train-dir path/to/training/session/ --out cdsemodel.pth
5. Validate the Model
Compare energies and forces between SCF calculations and ML predictions:

SCF Calculations:
Extract structures for SCF using scf_prepare_structures.py.
Perform SCF calculations using a bash script.
Use get_forces_scf and get_energies_scf to extract SCF results.
ML Predictions:
Use get_forces_model and get_energies_model to obtain ML predictions.
6. Visualize Results
Plot energy and force comparisons:

python energy_plot_result.py
python force_plot_result.py
